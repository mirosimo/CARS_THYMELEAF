# car_showroom - information system for fictive Car Showroom. 

Here appears source code to my training application in Spring Boot on which I have been working for last days. 
At this time the applications is consist of about 30 entities and similar number of tables in db. 
For now is in progress stuff around car configuration. Entities - CarBrand, CarModel, CarEquipmentPack, CarEngine, etc.
And the other branch where I am working on is around human resources - entity Employee, and many relational entities.
I was created 3 ER diagrams 
ER-human-resources
ER-car-variant
ER-rest-of

- which could be usefull for understanding the logic - folder xxx-documentation.
Also in folder xxx-documentation you can find some view examples - scrennshots. But is still in progress so is changing in time.
